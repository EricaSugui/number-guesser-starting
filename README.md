## Overview
This project is slightly different than others encountered in Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains open-ended requirements. There are many possible ways to correctly do the things, and they expect the alumni uses the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when encounter a problem that we cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals
Write Javascript functions to power a small guessing game. The code must run in the browser instead of just the terminal.

## Setup Instructions
This is a PRO Subscription challenge and there are a .zip  with the first files: 
- game.js
- index.js
- script.js
- style.css
- This README.md file was not in the package and I have done by myself. =ˆ.ˆ=

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this project, the alumni should have completed the first 3 sections of Introduction to Javascript (this is a free course in Codecademy available to all).

## Improvements
The default front of this project was not so beauty, so I edited the DOM and HTML files.
Below, the original appeareance in desktop and smartphones.

> Uma página frontend feita por desenvolvedor backend?.

> É, não tava legal não.

So, I decided to improve the front, using jQuery, Bootstrap and a little bit of patience.
Below, the new front:

> Refiz as classes e coloquei um pouco de cor.

And I added an About the Game page, below:
